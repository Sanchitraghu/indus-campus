      <h1 className="about-h1">OUR STORY</h1>
      <p className="about-p">
        Back in February 2023, Dr. Divya Rishi Sahu, one of our professors,
        spoke with a small group of us during a general discussion about how
        companies struggle to find cost-effective solutions to their problems,
        while many students struggle to find opportunities to apply their skills
        and gain practical experience.
        <br />
        A few days later, after some brainstorming, we came up with the idea of
        creating a platform to bridge these two worlds that benefits both
        students and companies.
        <br />
        We pitched the idea to the professor, who was enthusiastic about it, and
        we requested him to be our mentor. Under his supervision, we spent
        several weeks refining the idea and developing our website, and finally
        launched IndusCampus.
